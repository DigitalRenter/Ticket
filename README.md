# Basic Ticketing System
### Brief Overview
It is quite difficult to handle requests coming in from clients especially when there is need for further discussions. Sometimes, these leads are lost so we need to keep track of the person and the list of discussions that agents have had with these leads in order to make better and well informed decision so as to easily lead to a closed deal. 
### Request
- Create a mini ticketing system for incoming requests and give discussion sessions
- Data to be captured include
1.  Basic client info (name, tel, email, mode of aquisition)
2.  Heading of request and brief description
3.  Request type (purchase / sale)
4.  Tags (land, house, rent, sale, advertise, enquiry, ...)
5.  List of discussions held by agent and lead (agent info[], date and time of meeting, discussion, conclusion, next date of discussion)

## Task
Do a simple web user interface with react js to represent the various pages for this mini ticket system.
